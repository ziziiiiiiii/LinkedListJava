This project was made for CS 112, Fundamentals of Programming 2, at Allan Hancock College. It is written in Java. It is a linked list with basic functionality, as well as the ability to sort, shuffle, remove minimum, remove duplicates, reverse, and clear. It includes two Demo files to showcase the capabilities of the program.

Demo3 showcases the ability to add elements, print the contents of the list, sort the list, clear the list, and shuffle the list. Demo6 showcases the ability to remove elements at specific indices (through a loop which removes all values and shows the indices from which they were removed) and removing duplicates.

Each Demo file calls TestBench to add default data to the list. TestBench itself contains a test function which showcases the ability to: find the size of the list; add elements to the list at specific indices; get elements at specific indices; remove elements from specific indices; set values at specific indices; find the index
of specific elements; find the last index of specific elements; clear the list; and repopulate the list using its separate function to add default data.
